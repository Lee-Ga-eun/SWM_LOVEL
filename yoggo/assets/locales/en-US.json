She expresses it in the following way:\n\"Voice is an ineffable beauty. It is the purest and most precious gift.\nThough I have lost this cherished gift, I will embark on a journey\nto find true love through other means. Even without my voice,\nthe emotions and passions within me will not easily fade away.\nLove transcends language. In this quest to reclaim my precious voice,\nI will discover my true self and learn the ways of love and freedom.\"",
